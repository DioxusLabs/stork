/**
 * Downloads the search index file from the specified URL, and registers the

 *
 * This function returns a promise which resolves with the search index's statistics,
 * for debugging purposes. After the promise resolves, you will be able to run
 * search queries with the given index identifier, either via the `stork.search()`
 * function or via the attached <input> tag.
 *
 * This promise may fail for one of several reasons:
 *
 * - This function was called before `stork.initialize()` was called
 * - The index file could not be fetched at the given URL.
 * - The index file was downloaded, but could not be parsed by the WASM binary
 * - The WASM binary failed to load successfully, and the promise returned by
 *   `stork.initialize()` threw an error
 *
 * If the promise fails, you can try calling `stork.downloadIndex()` again.
 * If you call `stork.downloadIndex()` with the same index identifier and the
 * index file has already been downloaded, Stork will use the same index binary
 * unless `{forceRefreshIndex: true}` is included in the passed-in config.
 *
 * After the promise succeeds, any subsequent calls to `stork.downloadIndex()`
 * with the same index identifier will have no effect, unless
 * `{forceRefreshIndex: true}` is passed into the config, even if the given URL
 * is different. When `forceRefreshIndex` is true, the index will be
 * re-downloaded and reloaded into the WASM.
 *
 * If you call `stork.downloadIndex()` before a previous call with the same
 * index identifier has finished (i.e. before the promise has resolved or thrown),
 * the function will not perform any actions, and will return with the previous
 * in-flight promise.
 *
 * @param name The identifier of the index
 *
 * @param url The URL from which Stork will make an XMLHttpRequest to download the
 * index file

 * @param unsafeConfig A configuration object
